    <h1>Triangle</h1>
    <p><strong>Equilateral Triangle</strong> In geometry, an equilateral triangle is a triangle in
         which all three sides are equal. In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle 
         is also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and 
         are each 60Â°. It is also a regular polygon,
         so it is also referred to as a regular triangle.. </p>

    <p><strong>Isoceles Triangle</strong> In geometry, an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two
         sides of equal length. Sometimes it is specified as having exactly two sides of equal length, 
         and sometimes as having at least two sides of equal length, the latter version thus including
          the equilateral triangle as a special case.</p>
